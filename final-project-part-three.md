# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.

I changed the way certain numbers are represented instead of using 77%, I used 1 in 6 people as it has more affect.
I added Navigation panes in the shorthand for easy navigation to various statistics such as treatment, prevention and funding.
I ensured all the call to action links were working for different sources. 
Modified the scrolling to scroll points for more interesting zoomedin view of the african continent.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

> Initially I wanted to talk about modern medicine because of some examples I saw around me, and experiences my family has had. But since the subject went into vaccinations and other divergent topics, I realized the scope was too broad and I need to narrow it further. Picking up a disease and talking about was a good idea as scope was narrow and also would get specific audience opinion.

> As I researched more, I noticed that in asian countries especailly in India, there was less awareness, awareness about treatment and lot of stigma and misconceptions.
> I narrowed my audience to adults, and what information they knew about HIV aids.
