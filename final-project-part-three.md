# Changes made since Part II

Since the completion of Part II, I made several adjustments to enhance clarity and engagement. Instead of simply stating statistics like "77%," I opted to express data in more relatable terms, such as "1 in 6 people," which has a stronger impact. I also added navigation panes in the Shorthand story for easy access to various sections, including treatment, prevention, and funding.

Additionally, I ensured that all call-to-action links were functional and directed to the correct sources. I modified the scrolling feature to include scroll points, providing an engaging, zoomed-in view of the African continent to emphasize regional data.



## The audience

Initially, I wanted to focus on modern medicine due to personal experiences and examples around me. However, as I delved deeper, the scope became too broad, incorporating topics like vaccinations. I realized I needed to narrow the focus, so I decided to concentrate on HIV/AIDS, which provided a more specific direction and allowed me to target a more defined audience.

Through my research, I noticed that awareness of HIV treatment and the reduction of stigma was particularly low in Asian countries, especially in India. This discovery helped me narrow my audience to adults who may have limited knowledge about HIV/AIDS and its treatments. This focused approach allowed me to tailor the content more effectively to address common misconceptions.

## Final design decisions
Initially, I included a lot of information on the stigma surrounding HIV. However, after gathering audience feedback, I realized that this level of detail made some viewers uncomfortable. To adjust, I focused more on HIV prevention and eradication, which is still a significant global issue. I also reduced the number of graphs to simplify the storyline and added specific visualizations that were more engaging, such as data on condom use in Eswatini (the country most affected by HIV) and an area chart visualizing deaths averted due to antiretroviral therapy.

These design changes helped make the story more accessible and ensured the visualizations aligned with the narrative's focus.

# Final thoughts


Reflecting on this project, I wish I could have delved deeper into the issue of HIV stigma. However, finding sufficient data on this topic was challenging, and discussing it in class could have been sensitive. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed working with the HIV datasets, as there was a lot of data available. In hindsight, starting earlier would have allowed me to create better visualizations.

Initially, I found it difficult to decide on a story to tell, which made me realize how complex storytelling with data can be. This was also my first experience with user research, and I wasn't entirely sure how to proceed, so I presented an overview of my slides and gathered feedback. Through this, I learned that understanding your audience is not as straightforward as it seems—until you engage with them, you won’t fully grasp their needs.

Overall, this course provided an excellent opportunity to learn more about the art of storytelling through data, and I found it to be a valuable experience.
