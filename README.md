# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi! I am Shreya and I love data vizualisations. I am a graduate student studying MISM at Heinz. I have 3 years of experience in Supply Chain and Operations, and I would like to pursue a career in this domain.  I love photography, cycling and hiking. 

# What I hope to learn
1. Good Data Visualization
2. Effective Communication of data with leadership
3. Understand how to make good charts based on any kind of data.


## Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt.md)

This assignment focused on visualizing government debt across various countries. Tableau was used to create multiple visualizations based on the provided data, with an emphasis on presenting insights effectively. The assignment provided valuable understanding of the use of colors, chart types, and storytelling techniques to convey data more clearly.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)

This project involved exploring datasets and visualizations from MakeoverMonday. The objective was to select a visualization, analyze it, and apply critique methods such as Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and principles from Good Charts. Following the critique, a new visualization was created to address the identified concerns.

## Final project

The final project aimed to incorporate all learnings from Good Charts, classroom presentations, and critiques to create effective visualizations that tell a compelling and persuasive data-driven story. This project focused on the narrative of modern medicine and the eradication of diseases, with a specific emphasis on HIV eradication. Each section, from Part 1 to Part 3, illustrated the progress of scientific advancements, culminating in a detailed focus on HIV/AIDS in Part 3. Shorthand, journey maps, and storytelling techniques were utilized for the final assignment and presentation.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
