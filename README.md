# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi! I am Shreya and I love data vizualisations. I am a graduate student studying MISM at Heinz. I have 3 years of experience in Supply Chain and Operations, and I would like to pursue a career in this domain.  I love photography, cycling and hiking. 

# What I hope to learn
1. Good Data Visualization
2. Effective Communication of data with leadership
3. Understand how to make good charts based on any kind of data.


## Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt.md)

This assignment focused on visualizing government debt across various countries. Tableau was used to create multiple visualizations based on the provided data, with an emphasis on presenting insights effectively. The assignment provided valuable understanding of the use of colors, chart types, and storytelling techniques to convey data more clearly.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)

This project involved exploring datasets and visualizations from MakeoverMonday. The objective was to select a visualization, analyze it, and apply critique methods such as Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and principles from Good Charts. Following the critique, a new visualization was created to address the identified concerns.

## Final project

The final project aimed to incorporate all learnings from Good Charts, classroom presentations, and critiques to create effective visualizations that tell a compelling and persuasive data-driven story. This project focused on the narrative of modern medicine and the eradication of diseases, with a specific emphasis on HIV eradication. Each section, from Part 1 to Part 3, illustrated the progress of scientific advancements, culminating in a detailed focus on HIV/AIDS in Part 3. Shorthand, journey maps, and storytelling techniques were utilized for the final assignment and presentation.

3) [Part III](final-project-part-three.md)


## Final Thoughts

This project provided a valuable opportunity to deepen understanding of data visualization. Effective representation and visualization of data are crucial for data scientists, particularly in presenting information in a clear and impactful format.
