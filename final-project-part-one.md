# Outline
I want to show the effects of modern medicine and its advantages. How life expectancy has increased with the use of medicine and how advancements in this field are critical to improve quality of life. While natural remedies are often useful for smaller diseases, for age-related issues and other serious conditions, medicines and vaccines are key.

Project Structure
The project will follow a clear story arc, illustrating the progression of modern medicine's role in increasing life expectancy and enhancing the quality of life. The key sections include:

Introduction: Defining modern medicine and its significance with examples.

Medical Breakthroughs: Highlighting major advancements (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics).

Impact on Life Expectancy: Showing data on life expectancy improvements.

Current Challenges: Addressing the issues related to accessibility and affordability.

Conclusion: Summarizing the long-term benefits and future of modern medicine.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data

The Data
The primary data sources for this project focus on life expectancy trends, medical breakthroughs, and the impact of vaccinations, such as the eradication of polio.

Life Expectancy Data (World Bank):

This dataset tracks life expectancy globally from 1960 to the present. The data will be used to highlight trends in how life expectancy has increased over time and how key medical breakthroughs correlate with these improvements. I will use this data to show the significant shifts in life expectancy as modern medicine advanced, specifically in regions where vaccines and other medical treatments became more accessible.

Medical Advances and Life Expectancy (Swiss Re SONAR):

This source discusses the direct relationship between medical advances and life expectancy improvements. It provides a timeline of advancements, which I will use to support my analysis of specific medical breakthroughs (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics) and their influence on health outcomes.

Source: Swiss Re - Medical Advances

Vaccine Development Timeline (NCBI):

This table outlines the development timeline of key vaccines, including smallpox, polio, and measles. It will help establish a historical context for the role vaccines have played in public health improvements, which will be visually compared to the life expectancy data.

Together, these datasets will help demonstrate how advancements in modern medicine have not only extended life expectancy but also contributed to the overall improvement of public health by preventing and eradicating life-threatening diseases.
