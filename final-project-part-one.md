Outline

The project will explore the profound effects of modern medicine on human health, focusing on its role in increasing life expectancy and improving the quality of life. While natural remedies may be effective for minor ailments, modern medicine, especially in the form of surgeries, vaccines, and treatments for age-related diseases, has been key in combating serious illnesses. My goal is to educate and communicate how modern medicine can change lives, emphasizing trust in surgical procedures and medical technologies to increase life expectancy.

The target audience includes conservative or older individuals who may believe in the sufficiency of natural remedies and might be skeptical of modern medical interventions. This project aims to educate them on the critical role of modern medicine in improving health outcomes.

Project Structure

The project will follow a clear story arc that emphasizes the progression of modern medicine's role in increasing life expectancy. The key sections include:

Introduction:

Defining modern medicine and its significance with examples.
Highlighting the importance of surgical procedures and trusting technology.

Medical Breakthroughs:

Showcasing major advancements in the field of medicine (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics, vitamins, surgical technology).

Impact on Life Expectancy:

Presenting data on how life expectancy has dramatically improved due to these advancements.

Current Challenges:

Addressing concerns around accessibility, affordability, and public opinion about modern medicine, including skepticism toward vaccines and surgeries.

Conclusion:

Summarizing the long-term benefits of modern medicine.
Advocating for trust in new medical inventions and procedures for a healthier future.

Initial Sketches

The data visualizations will help tell the story of modern medicine's impact on life expectancy. Initial ideas for visualizations include:

Line Chart: Illustrating the trend in life expectancy improvements over time due to medical advancements, vaccines, and antibiotics.
Comparative Timeline: A historical journey map showing key medical breakthroughs (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics) and their correlation to major increases in life expectancy.
Journey Map: Highlighting the stark contrast between medical care in the 17th century and today, focusing on how treatment and survival outcomes have improved.

The visualizations aim to show impact of modern medicine on human health by comparing key metrics like death rates and life expectancy over time, as well as contrasting the medical journey of individuals from the 17th century to the present day. A line chart will show the reduction in death rates over the years due to advancements in treatments and vaccines, while another visualization will link major medical breakthroughs to increases in life expectancy. A journey map will highlight the contrast between how illnesses were diagnosed and treated in the past compared to the comprehensive and effective medical care available today and showcasing survival outcomes.

# The data

The Data
The primary data sources for this project focus on life expectancy trends, medical breakthroughs, and the impact of vaccinations, such as the eradication of polio.

Life Expectancy Data (World Bank):

This dataset tracks life expectancy globally from 1960 to the present. The data will be used to highlight trends in how life expectancy has increased over time and how key medical breakthroughs correlate with these improvements. I will use this data to show the significant shifts in life expectancy as modern medicine advanced, specifically in regions where vaccines and other medical treatments became more accessible.

Medical Advances and Life Expectancy (Swiss Re SONAR):

This source discusses the direct relationship between medical advances and life expectancy improvements. It provides a timeline of advancements, which I will use to support my analysis of specific medical breakthroughs (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics) and their influence on health outcomes.

Vaccine Development Timeline (NCBI):

This table outlines the development timeline of key vaccines, including smallpox, polio, and measles. It will help establish a historical context for the role vaccines have played in public health improvements, which will be visually compared to the life expectancy data.

Together, these datasets will help demonstrate how advancements in modern medicine have not only extended life expectancy but also contributed to the overall improvement of public health by preventing and eradicating life-threatening diseases.

# Method and medium


I plan to complete my final project by using a combination of data visualization tools and storytelling techniques to highlight the advancements in modern medicine and their impact on global health outcomes. I will use Tableau to create interactive visualizations, such as timelines and comparative charts, showing life expectancy trends and medical breakthroughs. These visualizations will be embedded in a GitHub Pages site(here) , where I will also document the key findings and analysis in markdown.
