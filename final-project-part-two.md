# High-Level Summary

Vaccines have been one of the most significant public health interventions in modern history. Their role in eradicating or controlling infectious diseases has dramatically improved global health outcomes. This project aims to showcase the benefits of vaccines by exploring their impact on eradicating diseases and improving longevity. 

Moreover, this project will advocate for the importance of investing in vaccines to combat various diseases beyond the currently covered illnesses. By addressing both the positive impacts and the current challenges, such as misconceptions around vaccine safety, the project will argue for stronger global investments in vaccine accessibility, affordability, and public awareness efforts.

# Project Structure

Setup:

The project will begin by introducing vaccine technology and how vaccines are developed and administered. This section will also outline life expectancy trends over the years, emphasizing the correlation between major vaccine breakthroughs and increased life expectancy. A line chart will illustrate key points in time where vaccine developments significantly impacted global health outcomes.

Anticipated Visuals:

Line chart: A timeline showing major vaccine breakthroughs (e.g., polio, smallpox, COVID-19) in relation to rising life expectancy across different regions of the world.

Conflict:

This section will explore the conflict arising from misinformation surrounding vaccines, particularly on social media platforms. In recent years, misinformation has fueled vaccine hesitancy, despite overwhelming scientific evidence of their safety and effectiveness. Additionally, the issue of vaccine accessibility and affordability in various parts of the world will be discussed. A data visualization will present populations that do not trust vaccines, mapped alongside access to vaccines across different socio-economic regions.

Anticipated Visuals:

Bar chart/Heat map: Population segments that display vaccine hesitancy or mistrust, categorized by region or demographic group.
Accessibility and affordability: A visualization comparing vaccine availability and affordability in high-income versus low-income countries.
Resolution:
The final section will focus on potential resolutions to the challenges posed by vaccine hesitancy and limited accessibility. The project will advocate for global efforts to increase awareness through scientific education, highlighting the role of vaccines in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, it will emphasize the need for increased investment in making vaccines more accessible and affordable to populations worldwide.

Anticipated Visuals:

Scatter plot/Map: A global view showing regions with increased vaccine investments and their corresponding public health outcomes.
Narrative visuals: Highlighting campaigns and organizations that have successfully raised vaccine awareness.


# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
