# High-Level Summary

This project will explore the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and its impact on public health efforts, prevention, and treatment. By analyzing trends in public perceptions, healthcare access, and the global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the project will highlight how stigma continues to hinder effective interventions. The goal is to shed light on the importance of combating stigma through education, policy changes, and increased accessibility to treatment.

# Project Structure

Setup:

Overview of HIV/AIDS: Key facts and figures.
Progress in treatment and prevention over the years.
Introduction to the stigma: Historical context and how it emerged.
Visualization: A timeline of HIV/AIDS discoveries, treatment advancements, and public attitudes over time.



Conflict:

Focus on the stigma and its consequences: social isolation, discrimination, and barriers to healthcare.
Analysis of the stigma’s effect on prevention efforts, treatment adherence, and mental health among those affected by HIV/AIDS.
Visualization: A heatmap or bar chart showing regions/countries with high HIV stigma levels and corresponding healthcare access rates.

Resolution:

Highlighting solutions: education, campaigns to raise awareness, anti-discrimination policies.
Global and regional efforts to reduce stigma and improve healthcare access.
Visualization: Case studies of successful stigma-reduction initiatives and their impact on HIV/AIDS outcomes.



# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

### Feedback Session One

The initial storyboard for the HIV/AIDS stigma project was tested with three participants – M(32), M(22), F(24).

### Purpose of the Study

The study aims to explore how stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS continues to hinder public health efforts, focusing on prevention and treatment. By understanding personal experiences, societal perceptions, and the challenges faced in healthcare access, this project hopes to highlight the ongoing effects of stigma on effective interventions.

### Target Audience and Participant Demographics

Through this study, I aim to reach young adults, healthcare professionals, and policymakers who can influence change. The story is designed to encourage reflection on stigma and its consequences on public health, especially in communities where misinformation and prejudice persist.

For the purpose of this user research, three participants from diverse age groups, gender, and social backgrounds were selected to offer varied perspectives on the issue. These participants were chosen based on their differing levels of awareness and personal connection to the HIV/AIDS epidemic to ensure a broad understanding of the stigma's impact.


### Interview Script: Sectional Review

After walking the research participants through the storyboard, ask them for a sectional review to gather their thoughts and reflections.

#### Section 1: Stigma and Awareness
Ask participants about their knowledge and understanding of the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and how it influences their views on public health.

**Questions to be answered:**
- How would you describe your understanding of the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS?
- Have you personally witnessed or experienced stigma related to HIV/AIDS in your community or media?

#### Section 2: Personal Impact of Stigma
Objective: Based on discussions around stigma, ask participants if they feel that stigma affects healthcare access and the willingness of individuals to seek treatment.

**Questions to be answered:**
- Do you think stigma around HIV/AIDS discourages people from seeking treatment or support?
- How do you believe the stigma affects the mental health of individuals living with HIV?

#### Section 3: Global Response
Objective: Based on information on the global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, ask participants about their perception of global efforts in combating stigma and improving healthcare.

**Questions to be answered:**
- What do you think about the global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic?
- Do you think more needs to be done to address stigma globally?

#### Section 4: Public Health and Policy
Objective: Based on discussions around healthcare and policy, ask participants about the role of policy changes in combating stigma and improving access to treatment.

**Questions to be answered:**
- Do you think policy changes could help reduce stigma and improve healthcare access for people living with HIV/AIDS?
- What types of policies do you believe would be most effective?

#### Section 5: Personal Reflection
End the study by asking open-ended questions, encouraging participants to reflect on the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and its impact on their views.

**Questions to be answered:**
- How has this conversation impacted your understanding of HIV/AIDS stigma?
- What actions do you think could help reduce the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS?

### Interview Script: Open-ended Questions (Overall)

After conducting the sectional review, proceed to open-ended questions to gather feedback on the overall features of the story.

1. What did you think about the title of the story? Any suggestions?
2. How engaging did you find the content? Were there any parts that stood out or felt lacking?
3. What do you think of the visuals and overall presentation? Do they support the message?
4. If you were to ask questions at the end of the story, what would those be?
5. What are your thoughts on how the sections are structured?
6. Any other comments or feedback?

# Identified changes for Part III

Next week, I will focus on implementing the following changes to improve the clarity, flow, and engagement of the story based on the insights gathered from the user interviews. These changes aim to enhance both the structure and presentation of the content while ensuring the story remains impactful and accessible.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title could be clearer and more direct   | Revise the title to better reflect the focus on HIV/AIDS stigma, using simple and direct language. |
| Section transitions are abrupt in places | Adjust the transitions between sections, especially from global trends to personal stories, to ensure smoother flow. |
| Visuals need better clarity and context  | Add contextual annotations to key visualizations, especially for the "stigma over time" chart, and reduce visual size. |
| Global trends visualization too complex  | Simplify the global trends visualization by focusing on key statistics instead of using a world map. |
| Final call to action needs to be open-ended | Modify the final call to action to ask reflective questions rather than prescriptive solutions. |
| Starter questions could be simplified    | Simplify starter questions to make them more accessible and easier to answer, leading into deeper discussions. |

In summary, the changes outlined above will help create a more cohesive and engaging narrative. These modifications are essential to making the story more relatable, understandable, and visually appealing, ensuring that readers can reflect on the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in a meaningful way.
